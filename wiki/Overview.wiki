#summary General Information About the Rendar Project.

= Introduction =

The Rendar project is an OpenGL scene grapher with the ability to load, at run-time, a plugin/modification to drive the rendering engine. 

The Rendar project is being developed concurrently on the Windows and Linux platforms.  Periodically, I compile the project under Windows 7 and Ubuntu 10.04 to ensure functionality.
